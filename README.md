### ► Core Features

-   **Text Polishing:** Refine phrasing, improve clarity, and adjust the tone of any text.
-   **Intelligent Translation:** Translate text with contextual awareness powered by a large language model.
-   **Dynamic Interface:** A clean, responsive UI built with React for a seamless user experience.

### ► What This Project Demonstrates

Beyond the functionality, this project showcases a modern approach to web application development:

*   **AI Integration:** Proficiency in consuming and integrating powerful third-party AI services (Gemini API) into a practical application.
*   **Secure Backend Proxy:** A critical architectural pattern. The Node.js/Express backend acts as a secure intermediary, protecting the API key from client-side exposure and managing requests to the AI service.
*   **Full-Stack TypeScript:** A commitment to robust, type-safe code across the entire stack (React frontend and Node.js backend), leading to more maintainable and less error-prone software.
*   **Modern Frontend Development:** Building a dynamic and stateful single-page application (SPA) using React and its component-based architecture.

### ► How to Run

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-link]
    ```
2.  **Setup Backend (Node.js):**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    # add your API key in gemini.ts
    npm start
    ```
3.  **Setup Frontend (React):**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
